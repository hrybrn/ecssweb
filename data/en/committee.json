By taking into account member feedback, especially from our postgraduate students, I plan to host a wider range of socials so that everyone feels included.

In addition, I wish to broaden my horizons and take on responsibilities which challenge me more than just academically. As a student rep I will act as a bridge in communication between the students and the ECSS and will aim to highlight all student feedback to the committee for discussion and actions. The social / fun events I attended so far have been incredible and I am motivated to take part in their planning and use them as a tool for increasing student participation in the ECSS. Furthermore, having done a few volunteering projects involving the organisation of events, I appreciate the work and preparation that goes into running them. I intend on using my previous experience to support me when helping the social secretary develop fun ways to involve more students in the ECSS. I am particularly looking forward to working alongside the rest of the committee in the organisation of guest speaker talks and networking events with companies from industry, which are to help students get a feel for the companies they will potentially apply to after graduation.
