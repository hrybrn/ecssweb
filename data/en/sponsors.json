Our sponsors also regularly bring in pieces of kit for live hardware demonstrations, such as Leonardo with their military grade thermal imaging camera.</p><p>Besides talks, we host hackathons and interview days. Hackathons are valuable events where teams of engineers collaborate on hardware/software projects, with the common purpose of completing an assigned challenge. They are great opportunities to use new kit, enhance your skills, and make new friends. The interview days are great opportunities to meet with companies, gain experience with interviews, and of course land a graduate job! ECS graduates are highly sought after.</p>",
