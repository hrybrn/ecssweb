			"1":"At ECSS we run socials to help people de-stress from the madness that is an ECS degree but also to meet people in the department. If you need to procrastinate, make friends or just chill and forget then this is for you.",
			"2":"Make sure to check out the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ecss.soton/'>ECSS Facebook page</a> to see when we host events.",
			"3":"Non-alcoholic",
			"4":"Not all of university is getting so drunk you forget your own name, and to accommodate that we run many non-alcoholic and more relaxed events. We have bowling, trips to scoops and pub quizzes planned so keep an eye out for those.",
			"5":"Alcoholic",
			"6":"As does every society at university, we also run alcoholic events. Two white t-shirt socials a year, the Halloween house crawl and pub golf are just a few of the rowdy nights we have to offer.",
			"7":"About the social sec",
			"8":"Hello! I am Luke Woolley your social sec for this year, and I am a second year studying Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I have bold plans for this year, I want to try and get more involved with other societies and have a larger range of events. My other hobbies include playing the saxophone, being a part of Toastrack and embarrassing myself on the dance floor. If you have any question or ideas for socials please shoot me a message!"
